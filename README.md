Conclusion
The far-reaching impact of the pandemic on home prices in the United States cannot be underestimated. The observable trend of many homebuyers securing properties below their listing prices as a result of the prevailing economic uncertainties. However, the average American is unable to afford a home and live comfortably in the United States.
Throughout the pandemic, the housing inventory across various regions experienced fluctuations, which could be attributed to a multitude of factors. Supply chain disruptions in construction materials led to inventory surges, while lower interest rates coupled with investor interest caused periods of scarcity. The allure of these low rates also prompted families to capitalize on opportunities, driving a surge in home sales, particularly in previously overlooked rural states like Omaha, NE, and Chicago, IL.

Our comprehensive analysis establishes a statistically significant correlation between the pandemic and the trajectory of home sale and listing prices. The persistent upward movement of these prices during the pandemic and its aftermath indicates transformation in the housing market. 

One remarkable shift brought about by the pandemic is the transition of job locations. Empowered by remote work possibilities, a considerable number of individuals and families have migrated to regions offering more affordable housing and a lower cost of living. As a result, the pandemic has reshaped not only the real estate landscape but also the geographical preferences of the populace.

The implications for prospective homebuyers are vast and multifaceted. Families, irrespective of their home's size, find themselves grappling with the financial implications of this shifting market. With the cost of housing becoming a large percentage of household budgets, it is evident that the pandemic's repercussions will continue to affect families for many years to come. The path towards achieving homeownership now means navigating a landscape fraught with newfound challenges.
