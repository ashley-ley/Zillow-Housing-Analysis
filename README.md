Team Members: Daniel Gomez, Hannah Varghese, Monila Khadka, Joel Johnson, Ashley Yakopec-Ley 

Description/Outline: Our group is analyzing the home market between January 2018 and July 2023. We will be comparing home prices from different time periods (pre-pandemic, during, and post-pandemic) to understand how the housing market was impacted nation-wide. We will analyze, at a state-level, to determine how families across different cities and states in the United States were impacted differently. 

Time Periods:
Pre-Pandemic: 2018-2020
During Pandemic: 2020-2021
Post-Pandemic: 2022-2023

Research Questions: 
How has the housing inventory fluctuated since pre-pandemic times? 
How has the Pandemic impacted Home Sale Prices from 2018-2023 and how have home prices changed since the beginning of the pandemic?  
  Which city/cities saw the greatest rate of increase in price? 
  How have listing prices changed based on square footage?
How is the housing market forecasted to change vs. the listing pricing that are currently available in the US? 
Where are the most affordable places to live in the United States in 2023 based on median price?
